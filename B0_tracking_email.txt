Hi Alex,

I'm seeing differences in B0 tracking efficiency between campaigns. I've attached a minimal working example that shows how I'm extracting B0 track information.

Key details:
- Branch used: ReconstructedTruthSeededChargedParticles
- Association: ReconstructedTruthSeededChargedParticleAssociations
- B0 acceptance: 5.5 mrad < theta < 20 mrad

The code (B0_tracking_MWE.cpp):
1. Loops over truth-seeded reconstructed particles
2. Filters for final-state protons (PDG=2212, genStatus=1)
3. Applies B0 angular acceptance cut
4. Produces histograms showing theta distributions

You mentioned that the B0 hits look the same between campaigns, so it's likely the tracking algorithm. This MWE should help identify where the difference is coming from.

Compile: g++ B0_tracking_MWE.cpp -o B0_tracking_MWE $(root-config --cflags --glibs)
Run: ./B0_tracking_MWE input_file.root

Output: B0_tracking_check.root (contains theta distributions)

Thanks for looking into this!
